# wow-raid-death-analyzer
This is a tool that I created with the intent to be used by raid leaders to identify what abilities are killing raiders over the course of an entire raid night / log. Uses Warcraftlogs API and requires an API key from them in the form of a .env file. This is NOT provided as I'm not letting people get a hold of my API key.  
This requires a APIv1 key from https://www.warcraftlogs.com/profile and for it to be in an .env file.
