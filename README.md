# wow-raid-death-analyzer
this is a tool that i created with the intent to be used by raid leaders to identify what abilities are killing raiders over the course of an entire raid night / log. uses warcraft logs API and requires an API key from them in the form of a .env file. this is NOT provided as im not letting people get ahold of my API key
